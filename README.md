# HawalaCoin

A DApp for getting money into hard places

## Truffle

We use Truffle to manage our contracts locally.
If you make changes to the solidity contracts you'll need to run truffle compile in order to update the ABI which is used by the DApp
```
cd truffle
truffle compile
```

Note it's easiest to install truffle globally with
```
npm install --global truffle
```
